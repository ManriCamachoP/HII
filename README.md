# Hurricane Impact Index 

## Abstract
Hurricanes rank among the most destructive natural hazards. They are complex
phenomena that can cause both direct damage along their path and indirect
impacts due to heavy rainfall and strong winds, with effects varying according
to regional topography. In this paper, we propose a Hurricane Impact Index to
assess both direct and indirect hazards, and we demonstrate its applicability to
the Central American region. The index is constructed so that we can decompose
these effects across multiple dimensions of time and space, enabling a detailed
analysis of the intensity and distribution of hurricane impacts.
